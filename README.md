# üèà AI Sports Bot NFL - Beta

An intelligent conversational AI system for NFL sports statistics, player analysis, and dynamic debate generation. This bot transforms natural language questions into structured API queries and provides comprehensive, contextual responses about NFL players, teams, and statistics.

## üéØ Overview

The AI Sports Bot NFL leverages advanced natural language understanding and multi-agent architecture to provide:

- **Intelligent Query Processing**: Convert complex sports questions into structured data requests
- **Real-time NFL Statistics**: Access comprehensive player and team statistics through RapidAPI
- **Dynamic Player Comparisons**: Generate engaging debate-style comparisons between players
- **Smart Disambiguation**: Handle ambiguous player names with intelligent clarification
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Support for complex queries spanning multiple players, teams, and seasons

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **Multi-Agent System** (`sports_agents.py`)
The orchestration layer that coordinates between specialized agents:

```
User Query ‚Üí NLU Agent ‚Üí Query Planner ‚Üí Data Retrieval ‚Üí Response Formatting
```

- **NLU Agent**: Parses natural language and extracts sports entities
- **Query Planner**: Enriches queries with execution strategies and data source planning
- **Stat Retriever**: Interfaces with NFL APIs to fetch real-time data
- **Response Formatter**: Generates contextual, user-friendly responses

#### 2. **Natural Language Understanding** (`query_types.py`)
Advanced query classification and processing:

- **QueryType Enumeration**: Single player stats, comparisons, team queries, etc.
- **QueryClassifier**: Intelligent routing based on query complexity
- **QueryExecutor**: Handles specialized execution patterns
- **Edge Case Handler**: Manages ambiguous or complex scenarios

#### 3. **API Integration Layer** (`stat_retriever.py`)
Robust interface to NFL data sources:

- **Intelligent Player Resolution**: Handles name disambiguation across teams
- **Dynamic Endpoint Selection**: Routes queries to appropriate API endpoints
- **Comprehensive Stats Schema**: Standardized mapping of NFL statistics
- **Error Handling & Validation**: Graceful handling of API limitations

#### 4. **Debate Engine** (`debate_agent.py`, `debate_integration.py`)
AI-powered player comparison system:

- **Dynamic Debate Generation**: Creates engaging player vs. player arguments
- **Evidence-based Analysis**: Uses real statistics to support arguments
- **Multiple Debate Styles**: Supports various comparison frameworks

#### 5. **Configuration Management** (`api_config.py`)
Centralized API configuration with support for:

- RapidAPI NFL endpoints
- Authentication management
- Endpoint routing and parameter handling
