🗄️ Multi-Level Cache Architecture:

Level 1 - Individual Player Stats (1 hour TTL):
   Key: player_id + stat_type + season
   Value: Raw stats response
   
Level 2 - League Rankings (30 min TTL):
   Key: stat_name + season + position_filter  
   Value: Sorted list of all players
   
Level 3 - Position Rosters (24 hour TTL):
   Key: position + season
   Value: List of player IDs by position

🚀 Performance Benefits:
   • First "Who leads NFL in sacks?" query: ~1600 API calls
   • Subsequent queries in 30 mins: 0 API calls (cache hit)
   • Position-filtered queries: ~300 API calls (vs 1600)
   • User gets instant results after initial cache warming

print("""
Week 1 Priority: 🔍 Fuzzy Search (Quick Win)
   ✅ Lowest effort, high impact
   ✅ No additional API calls needed
   ✅ Improves existing functionality immediately
   
Week 2 Priority: 🏆 League Leaders  
   ✅ Highest user value
   ✅ Unlocks "Who leads NFL in..." queries
   ✅ Foundation for all ranking features

Week 3 Priority: 🏈 Position Filtering
   ✅ Enables "Best quarterbacks" queries  
   ✅ Reduces API calls through smart filtering
   ✅ More targeted and relevant results
