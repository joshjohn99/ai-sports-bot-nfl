"""
NFL Debate Agent Implementation.

This module provides a debate agent for NFL statistics and player comparisons.
It uses the NFL API to fetch real-time data and generate structured debates
about players, teams, and their performance.

Example:
    ```python
    async with DebateAgent(api_key="your_api_key") as agent:
        debate = await agent.generate_debate(DebateContext(
            query="Compare Kyler Murray and Josh Allen",
            player_names=["Kyler Murray", "Josh Allen"],
            metrics=["completions", "passingYards"]
        ))
    ```
