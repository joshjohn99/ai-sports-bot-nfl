## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- Use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black default)

### Code Organization
```python
# Standard library imports
import os
import sys
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

# Third-party imports
import requests
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Local imports
from sports_bot.config.api_config import api_config
from sports_bot.utils.helpers import format_player_name
```

### Documentation
- Use docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
- Follow [Google Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) docstrings
- Include type hints for all function parameters and return values

```python
def fetch_player_stats(player_name: str, season: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Fetch statistics for a specific player and season.
    
    Args:
        player_name: The player's full name
        season: The season year (e.g., "2024")
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing player statistics
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If player name is invalid
        APIError: If API request fails
    """
    pass
```

### Testing
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use `pytest` for testing framework
- Aim for >90% code coverage
- Include both unit tests and integration tests

```python
def test_fetch_player_stats():
    """Test player statistics fetching."""
    result = fetch_player_stats("Josh Allen", "2024")
    assert result["success"] is True
    assert "passing_yards" in result["data"]
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Adding New Sports
1. Update `sport_registry.py` with new sport configuration
2. Create sport-specific adapter if needed
3. Add tests for the new sport
4. Update documentation

### Adding New Query Types
1. Add to `QueryType` enum in `query_types.py`
2. Implement execution logic in `QueryExecutor`
3. Add response formatting in `ResponseFormatter`
4. Create comprehensive tests

### Adding New Agents
1. Create agent class in `src/sports_bot/agents/`
2. Follow the existing agent interface patterns
3. Add integration with the agent bridge
4. Include proper error handling and logging

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_phase1_comprehensive.py -v

# Integration tests
python test_integration_final.py

# With coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src/sports_bot --cov-report=html
```

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Test API efficiency and caching

### Writing Good Tests
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases)
- Keep tests fast and isolated

## üìã Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines

```

### Review Process
1. Automated checks must pass (tests, linting)
2. At least one maintainer review required
3. Address all feedback before merge
4. Squash commits if requested
